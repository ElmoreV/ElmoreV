### Hierarchical-tag based File Manager

Many of the file managers I see have two modes: files and folders, or tags/keywords.  
Have you ever though: should I put this file in:

- Work/
    - 2023/
         - Meeting notes/
              - meeting.docx

Or
  - Work/
    - Meeting notes/
         - 2023/
              - meeting.docx

Or a photo in 

- Photos/
    - Holiday in Mallorca

or

- Photos/
    - 2023/
       - Holiday in Mallorca/
            - Photo.raw

or

- Photos/
    - Holidays/
       - Mallorca 2023/
            - Photo.raw

Using keywords are tedious: you might want all holidays instead of just 'mallorca', but you will probably only tag it 'Mallorca' instead of all other necessary tags to fulfill this. This project will solve this. It will use hierarchical tags, meaning: files only exist in one place, but can be found exactly as wanted, by all tags. No more dabbling over trivial questions. No more incessant clicking in the File Explorer. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### Quantum MANY Body Simulations

Generally, simulations in Quantum Mechanics stop at simulating a single particle Schr√∂dinger Equations, or go to the other extreme of simulating particles only at the Fermi energy, after applying a ton of approximations. This project is a test to see how much these approximations are really necessary. An example is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which removes phonons from the picture. Afterwards people introduce a phenomenological bosonic model of phonons that works very well. The steps in between these two are up to this date very opaque. And very intriguing for Superconductivity, based on the phonon-electron interaction. Could we even simulate superconducting hydrogen? Not yet committed to GitHub.

### [Optimizing rote-learning by test-software](https://github.com/ElmoreV/py_intrarepetition_spacing)

There have been several investigations in the memory model, how we engrain facts in our brain. There have been some exciting new items in the last year. There are still some puzzle-pieces missing. This is my attempt at cracking it.

### Topic/week/day-based planner.

I have found my own way of planning my week that exactly suits my needs. I intend on launching a Website soon that allows interaction with an SQL database for the different To-do's. Through this, I will learn Java, a front-end framework and interaction with SQL. It should include

- Front-end
    - Different views of the same data (per-topic, weekly, daily).
    - Drag and drop style tasks
    - Easy adding, removing and changing tasks by clicking natural UX design

- Back-end
    - (Hierarchical) tags of a task
    - Current statuss of a task (not started, partially done, done, waiting for a response/blocked)
    - Sub-tasking
    - Dependencies on other tasks
    - Deadlines
    - Duration and difficulty

## Past projects

### pyGDSign

In this project I have implemented a framework for fast prototyping different 2D planar CAD design (with multiple layers) in Python. Perfect for researchers. It uses an anchor system and makes it (programmatically) a drag-and-drop type interface to create your own design quickly, and to share them and their building blocks (DesignElements) without any efforts. Great for collaborative teams.
Another notable feature is the automatic documentation of the DesignElements, which outputs a SVG-file in which the adjustable parameters are changed to give a visual representation of what they do. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### [CleanSearch](https://github.com/ElmoreV/CleanSearch)

One of my oldest real projects (read: 2008) written in C++ for searching for files in Windows, as I felt the native Windows Search was lacking. It still is, so I am still using and maintaining this.
It has a home-brew parsing functionality built-in (you can search for "music?", or use "apples|oranges" to search for both, or "*.pdf"). Look in the repository to learn more! Not yet committed to GitHub.

### A Rat's Tale

A game made in C++ using the SDL framework as part of my high-school final project, together with my project partner. It's a 2D platformer, with a rat that can draw platforms on the fly with his tail. The levels can be edited, as it's based on a simple text-file based ASCII grid, that translated. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### Maxwell's distribution from Exact Kinetic Gas</b>

A Python-based simulation program. It is a collection of balls, where the (perfectly) elastic collisions are solved exactly, and - more importantly - in order. There are no approximations or 'collision forces' as is usual in such simulations. It reproduces the Maxwell distribution, as is expected. It also gives a physical interpretation for the concepts of pressure, temperature, giving the exact gas law. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### GitHub pages website

A static GitHub Pages website (it doesn't even allow backend!) created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), so it is amazingly fast. I'm using it as a blog with themes of:

- Physics
- Mathematics
- Computer simulations
- Computer science concepts

### Fast (and error-tolerant) MIDI-playback

At the same time, I found that some of my MIDI - I had some MIDI files with a really high note-playback-timing - that Windows Media Player could not handle. Again, this was around 2009-2010. This meant that I wrote my own, and used the Windows Wavetable to synthesize the different MIDI sounds. It's surprising how many broken MIDI files are online. And also surprising how well this little program handled it! It has a hack that can handle the input of the arrow keys to increase/decrease speed. I think I also had an arrow key to go forwards/backwards 5 seconds. I do not have this on GitHub yet. 

### 21st Dinner Website

A website built in native HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. It is in Dutch and anonymized, but the animations and the registering form would work in a server environment. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### Elmore's Extraordinary Extravaganza

A yearly digital competition held with friends. Data has been anonymized, but there are some challenges that can be done without inside knowledge. Not yet committed to GitHub.

### LINGO

Based on the Dutch television show LINGO (which is based on the American show LINGO). Made before the rise of Wordle, but works about the same. You can make your own list of words and make some fun personalized 'Wordle'-experiences. Not yet committed to GitHub.
