### Hi, welcome to my Portfolio

If I haven't told you already, here you can find an overview of my projects.

Notable projects are:

<b>pyGDSign</b>

In this project I have implemented a framework for fast prototyping different 2D planar CAD design (with multiple layers) in Python. Perfect for researchers. It uses an anchor system and makes it (programmatically) a drag-and-drop type interface to create your own design quickly, and to share them and their building blocks (DesignElements) without any efforts. Great for collaborative teams.
Another notable feature is the automatic documentation of the DesignElements, which outputs a SVG-file in which the adjustable parameters are changed to give a visual representation of what they do.

<b>CleanSearch</b>

A very old project (read: 2008-ish) written in C++ for searching for files in Windows, as I felt the native Windows Search was lacking. Has a home-brew parsing functionality built-in (you can search for "music?", or use "apples|oranges" to search for both, or "*.pdf"). I am still using this, and am maintaining this so it still works in Windows 10. 

<b>A Rat's Tale</b>

A game made in C++ using the SDL framework as part of my high-school final project, together with my project partner. It's a 2D platformer, with a rat that can draw platforms on the fly with his tail. The levels can be edited, as it's based on a simple text-file based ASCII grid, that translated. 

<b>Maxwell's distribution from Exact Kinetic Gas</b>

A Python-based simulation program. It is a collection of balls, where the (perfectly) elastic collisions are solved exactly, and - more importantly - in order. There are no approximations or 'collision forces' as is usual in such simulations. It reproduces the Maxwell distribution, as is expected. It also gives a physical interpretation for the concepts of pressure, temperature, giving the exact gas law.

<b>21st Dinner Website</b>

A website built in native HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. It is in Dutch and anonymized, but the animations and the registering form would work in a server environment.

<b>Elmore's Extraordinary Extravaganza</b>

A yearly digital competition held with friends. Data has been anonymized, but there are some challenges that can be done without inside knowledge. See the repository for more.

<b>Quantum MANY Body Simulations</b>

Generally, simulations in Quantum Mechanics stop at simulating a single particle Schr√∂dinger Equations, or go to the other extreme of simulating particles only at the Fermi energy, after applying a ton of approximations. This project is a test to see how much these approximations are really necessary. An example is the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which removes phonons from the picture. Afterwards people introduce a phenomenological bosonic model of phonons that works very well. The steps in between these two are up to this date very opaque. And very intriguing for Superconductivity, based on the phonon-electron interaction. Could we even simulate hydrogen?

<b>LINGO</b>

Based on the Dutch television show LINGO (which is based on the American show LINGO). Made before the rise of Wordle, but works about the same. You can make your own list of words and make some fun personalized 'Wordle'-experiences.
